			<h2>I Love Soccer.</h2>
			<p>I have been playing soccer since I was a child. I played for a number of teams, including my high school team. I wouldn't say I was the best in the team but I surely had an impact playing in the team. I used to play for a local team here too but since I have college going on right now and other things, I have temporarily stopped playing it. My most memorable moment of playing soccer is getting to play with my dear friends, with whom I spent all my childhood. I will be trying out for the soccer team here next season and I would love to again enjoy the moments and have some fun here.</p>
			<p>This picture is just me enjoying and watching my team play..
