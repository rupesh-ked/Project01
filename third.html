			<h2>About me.</h2>
			<p>Hi again. I am glad that you took your time to look at my work and interests. I am Rupesh and I am from NEPAL. I am an international undergraduate student and it's my second year here in the USA. My major is IT (Information Technology). I love to talk to new people and hear about them and share about me too. During my time after college and work, I usually love to listen to songs or maybe watch some movies or anime or go to the gym. I also love dancing but, sadly, not good at it.</p>
			<p>If you want to know about me, there's a link to my instagram at the bottom of this page. I'll see you again someday, somewhere. Byeeee</p>
