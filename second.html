			<h2>Biking!!!</h2>
			<p>Biking is not a sport that I used to do often like soccer. I did have a bike at my home but it was just road-biking there. I started mountain-biking after coming here and I have loved it since then. When it was my first year here, I used to fo biking almost every week, with some of my peers. We did biking on challenging tracks, night times and different bike parks. Now too, I try to go on biking with some friends if we get time.</p>
